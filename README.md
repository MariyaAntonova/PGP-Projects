Projects I did during my Postgraduate program on AI/ML

[**Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/Stock_market_news_sentiment_analysis.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing_ <br>
Develop an an AI-driven sentiment analysis system that will automatically process and analyze news articles to gauge market sentiment, and summarize the news at a weekly level to enhance the accuracy of their stock price predictions and optimize investment strategies.

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
Large Language Models / Transformers / Prompt Engineering / Exploratory Data Analysis / Data Manipulation / Word Embeddings / Text Preprocessing


[**Image classification using CNNs**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/image_classification.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Introduction to Computer Vision_ <br>
To identify the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
Keras / CNN / Working With Images / Computer Vision


[**Bank Customer Churn Prediction**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/Bank_churn_prediction.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Introduction to Neural Networks_ <br>
Analyze the customer data, build a neural network to help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn, and provide recommendations on how to retain such customers

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
EDA / Data Preprocessing / Tensorflow / Keras / Artificial Neural Networks / Regularization


[**Credit Card Users Churn Prediction**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/Credit_card_churn_prediction.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Advanced Machine Learning_ <br>
Analyze the data and come up with a predictive model to determine if a customer will leave the credit card services or not and the reason behind it

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
EDA / RANDOM FOREST / Bagging / Boosting / SMOTE / Cross Validation / Data Preprocessing / Hyperparameter Tuning


[**Personal Loan Campaign**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/Personal_loan_campaign.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Machine Learning_ <br>
To identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan, you need to analyze the provided data to understand key customer attributes influencing loan acquisition. With this analysis, build a predictive model that captures patterns and customer characteristics, which will help the bank effectively target potential loan buyers, improving marketing efforts and increasing conversion rates.

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
EDA / Data pre-processing / Model building - Decision Tree / Model Performance Evaluation and Improvement / Business Recommendations


[**FoodHub**](https://github.com/MariyaAntonova/PGP-Projects/blob/main/Python_foundations.ipynb) <br>

_Course: Python Foundations_ <br>
Perform an exploratory data analysis and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants and cuisines, which will help them enhance their customer experience and improve the business

_Skills & Tools Covered_ <br>
python / Numpy / Pandas / Seaborn / Univariate Analysis / Bivariate Analysis / Exploratory Data Analysis / Business recommendations
